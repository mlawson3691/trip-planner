                    <p>The four of us, Aimen, Biggy, Mark and Molly met at a programming bootcamp in the heart of Portland, OR in 2016. What started as a 4-day project to wrap up the last week of bootcamp evolved into a vision that we beleived could change the way the world travelled. "Team name" was launched in October that year, and has gone from a 4-person group of Epi-homies to a strong team of 25 in development, marketing, sales, operations, and administration. Our journey has only just begin, but the future is looking bright.</p
